                    <p><!-- open paragraph -->
                        Hi, my name is Diana Fridelova, and I am an intuitive and multi-hyphenate creative born in Slovak to a Cuban mother and a Slovak father. I spent the first 18 years of my life moving around the world with my parents and moving so much allowed me to stay in a constant state of flux and always keep a student mentality. I love art, design, food, fashion, and health, but above all, interested in what makes humans tick. I enjoy working out/hanging out with my friends, attending music festivals & trying new restaurants (because food is life). 
                        I have a Bachelor in Fine Arts in Sculpture from the USF and a UX Immersion certificate from Careerfoundry. During my studies, I was an active artist; however, I also worked in Customer Service because I love interacting with people. My travels as a child helped me thrive in customer-centered and mediator roles. 
                        Now I am a practicing Product Designer who wants to connect people to their playfulness, empathy, and compassion. I bring a multidisciplinary approach to collaborative work, a keen eye for detail, and contagious enthusiasm.
